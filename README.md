# OneWindow CIF & Account Automation Framework
Automated **Customer Information Form (CIF)** and **Account creation workflows** for the One Window banking application using **Selenium**, **Java**, and **Cucumber (BDD)**.  

This project demonstrates **enterprise-level automation** for banking workflows, showing my ability to implement **fully automated, maintainable, and modular test frameworks**.

---

## 🌍 Overview
This project highlights my expertise in **automation engineering and BDD methodology** within a complex enterprise banking system.  

Key aspects include:

- Fully automated CIF and account creation workflows in One Window banking application  
- Structured and readable **Cucumber (BDD) test scenarios** using Gherkin syntax  
- Automation executed entirely without manual intervention  
- Demonstrates **scalable, reusable, and maintainable automation frameworks** for enterprise applications  

⚠️ **Note:** This project is designed for an enterprise environment. The code cannot run outside the One Window application but demonstrates my automation skills.

---

## 🎯 Key Achievements
- Automated **end-to-end CIF and account creation workflows**  
- Built **reusable step definitions and modular automation components**  
- Structured **BDD scenarios** for clarity, readability, and maintainability  
- Delivered a **recorded demo of the automated workflow** for recruiter and stakeholder review  
- Demonstrated hands-on expertise in **pure automation of enterprise banking workflows**  

---

## 🧰 Technology Stack
- **Java** – primary programming language  
- **Selenium WebDriver** – UI automation  
- **Cucumber (BDD)** – readable and structured test execution using Gherkin  
- **Maven** – build and dependency management  
- **Page Object Model (POM)** – modular and maintainable UI abstraction  

---

## 📝 Project Approach
- **BDD methodology:** Test scenarios written in **Cucumber (BDD)** for structured and maintainable automation  
- **Modular Step Definitions:** Reusable steps reduce duplication and increase scalability  
- **Workflow-focused automation:** Emphasis on **pure automation methodology**, not external data input  
- **Automation Recording:** Screenshots and demo video provide proof of automated execution

## 🔍 Workflow Architecture


**Flow:** Gherkin Scenarios → Step Definitions → Page Objects → Selenium WebDriver → One Window Banking UI  

This architecture demonstrates **clean separation of test logic, business steps, and UI interactions**, ensuring maintainable and scalable automation.

## 🎥 Automation Recording
A **screen recording of the automated workflow** is included in the repository.  
It demonstrates:  

- Fully automated CIF and account creation flows  
- Execution of multiple scenarios defined in Gherkin  
- Pure automation without any manual intervention  

**Path in repository:** `/recordings/Submit_customer_information_where_Sector_Code_is_1019___Self_Employed.mp4`  
*(Recruiters and stakeholders can review the live automation workflow here.)*
