# OneWindow CIF & Account Automation Framework
Automated **Customer Information Form (CIF)** and **Account creation workflows** for the One Window banking application using **Selenium**, **Java**, and **Cucumber (BDD)**.  

This project highlights my **enterprise-level automation expertise** and demonstrates how I build scalable, maintainable, and professional automation frameworks for banking applications.

---

## 🌍 Overview
This automation framework showcases my ability to implement **robust, modular, and reusable test automation** for complex banking workflows.  
Key aspects include:

- Automating CIF and account creation workflows in One Window banking application  
- **Excel-driven, data-driven automation** to handle multiple customer entries and test scenarios  
- Managing empty-field or partial-data workflows efficiently  
- Demonstrating enterprise automation methodology, with focus on **reusability and maintainability**  

⚠️ **Note:** This framework is designed for an enterprise environment. It cannot run outside the banking application. The repository demonstrates my automation skills and methodology.

## 🎯 Key Achievements
- Automated **end-to-end CIF and account creation workflows**  
- Built **reusable step definitions and modular components** for scalable test automation  
- Designed **data-driven automation using Excel** for multiple customer scenarios  
- Structured tests for **easy extension, maintainability, and readability**  
- Delivered a **workflow recording** demonstrating automation in action  
- Showcased hands-on expertise in **enterprise banking automation**  

---

## 🧰 Technology Stack
- **Java** – primary programming language for automation  
- **Selenium WebDriver** – automated UI testing  
- **Cucumber (BDD)** – readable and structured test execution  
- **Maven** – build and dependency management  
- **Apache POI / Excel** – data-driven testing and multi-entry automation  
- **Page Object Model (POM)** – modular and maintainable UI abstraction  

---

## 📝 Project Approach
- **BDD methodology:** Test scenarios written in **Cucumber (BDD)** for clarity and maintainability  
- **Modular Step Definitions:** Reusable steps reduce duplication and increase scalability  
- **Data-driven execution:** Uses Excel input to drive multiple customer creation scenarios  
- **Workflow-focused automation:** Emphasis on **automation methodology**, not just application execution  
- **Visualization:** Workflow recording and screenshots provide proof of automated execution

## 🔍 Workflow Architecture

**Flow:** Excel Data → Step Definitions → Page Objects → Selenium WebDriver → One Window Banking UI  

This architecture demonstrates **clean separation of test logic, business steps, and UI interaction**, ensuring maintainable and scalable automation.
