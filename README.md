Automated Customer Information Form (CIF) and Account creation workflows for One Window banking application using Selenium, Java, and Cucumber (BDD).

---

## Overview
This project showcases my expertise in **enterprise banking automation** and **BDD (Behavior Driven Development)**.  
It demonstrates automation engineering skills including:

- Selenium WebDriver for UI automation
- Cucumber & Gherkin for readable test scenarios
- Java and Maven for development and dependency management

**Note:** This project is part of an enterprise environment. The code demonstrates my automation skills but cannot be run outside the enterprise application.

---

## Technology Stack
- **Java** – programming language
- **Selenium WebDriver** – automated UI testing
- **Cucumber & Gherkin** – BDD-style test scenarios
- **Maven** – dependency and build management

---

## Key Achievements
- Automated end-to-end customer information and account creation workflows
- Implemented reusable step definitions for maintainability and scalability
- Structured tests for easy extension and modularity
- Demonstrated hands-on expertise in enterprise banking automation

---

## Project Approach
- Test scenarios are written in **Gherkin** for clarity and readability
- Step definitions follow **modular design principles**
- Focus is on demonstrating **automation methodology**, not on running the enterprise application
